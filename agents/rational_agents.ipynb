    "## What is a agent?\n",
    "\n",
    "A agent is anything, that percives and acts.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A agent perveives the environment through sensors (-> Percepts)\n",
    "* A agent acts upon the environment through actuators (-> Actions)\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Human-Agent: A human agent has eyes, ears, and other organs which for for sensors and hand, legs, arms work for actuators.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Robotic-Agent: A robotic agent can have cameras, infrared range finder for sensors and motors as actuators.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Software-Agent: Software agent can have keystrokes, file contents as sensors and act upon this inputs, output via displaying results on screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rational agents\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition: Rational agent\n",
    "For each possible percept sequence, a rational agent should select an action that is expected to maximize its performance measure, given the evidence provided by the percept sequence and whatever built-in knowledge the agent has.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rationality:\n",
    "The rationality of an agent is measured by its performance measures. Rationality can be judged on the basis of follwoing points:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Performance measures (goals)\n",
    "* Percept sequences\n",
    "* Knowledge of the environment\n",
    "* Possible actions\n",
    "\n",
    "An ideal rational agent acts upon the function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "Percept Sequence x Word Knowledge -> Action\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Agent Type | Performance Measures | Environment | Actuators | Sensors |\n",
    "| ----------------- | ------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------ |\n",
    "| vacuum cleaner  | cleanness, battery life, efficency | room, carpet, wood floor, obstacles | wheels, brushes, vacuum extractor | camera, dirt sensor, infrared sensor |\n",
    "| medical diagnose system  | healthy patient, minimize costs | hospital, patient, staff | tests, treatments | keyboard (typing in symptoms) |\n",

    " * Architecture which also provides an interface to the environment (percepts, actions)\n",

    "\n",
    "| Environment Type | |\n",
    "| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| Accessible vs. inaccessible | Are the relevant aspects of the environment accessible to the sensors? |\n",
    "| Deterministic vs. stochastic | Is the next state of the environment completely determined by the current state and the selected action? If only actions of other agents are nondeterministic, the environment is called strategic. |\n",
    "| Episodic vs. sequential | Can the quality of an action be evaluated within an episode (perception + action), or are future developments decisive for the evaluation of quality? |\n",
    "| Static vs. dynamic | Can the environment change while the agent is deliberating? If the environment does not change but if the agentâ€™s performance score changes as time passes by the environment is denoted as semi-dynamic. |\n",
    "| Discrete vs. continuous | Is the environment discrete (chess) or continuous (a robot moving in a room)? |\n",
    "| Single agent vs. multi-agent | Which entities have to be regarded as agents? There are competitive and cooperative scenarios |\n",
