# Environments

| Environment Type | |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Accessible vs. inaccessible | Are the relevant aspects of the environment accessible to the sensors? |
| Deterministic vs. stochastic | Is the next state of the environment completely determined by the current state and the selected action? If only actions of other agents are nondeterministic, the environment is called strategic. |
| Episodic vs. sequential | Can the quality of an action be evaluated within an episode (perception + action), or are future developments decisive for the evaluation of quality? |
| Static vs. dynamic | Can the environment change while the agent is deliberating? If the environment does not change but if the agentâ€™s performance score changes as time passes by the environment is denoted as semi-dynamic. |
| Discrete vs. continuous | Is the environment discrete (chess) or continuous (a robot moving in a room)? |
| Single agent vs. multi-agent | Which entities have to be regarded as agents? There are competitive and cooperative scenarios |
